üöÆ Smart Campus Waste Management ‚Äî Workflow Summary
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Layer

The system has IoT-enabled smart bins that send data about their fill levels (simulated here).

Each bin has attributes like:
id, lat, lng, fill %, status (OK / FULL).

A set of autonomous vehicles (waste collectors) are initialized as IDLE.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger & Detection

When a bin‚Äôs fill level reaches 100%, it automatically generates an alert (/fill_random or auto simulation).

The backend immediately adds an entry to the alerts list with a timestamp.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment Logic

When a bin is FULL, the system calculates Haversine distances from all available (IDLE) vehicles.

The nearest vehicle is assigned to that bin (/assign_nearest_full).

The assignment is logged in:

assignments ‚Äî who was assigned when.

comparison_stats ‚Äî includes other vehicles and their distances for analytical comparison.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicle Animation & Route

On the map, the assigned vehicle‚Äôs route is drawn using Leaflet Routing Machine.

The vehicle moves dynamically along the calculated route using an animation (MovingMarker).

Voice narration (speech synthesis) announces:

The task assignment (with distance & ETA).

The completion message after arrival.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Trip Completion

Once the vehicle finishes its path:

It calls /complete_trip/{vid}/{bid}.

The bin‚Äôs fill resets to 0% and status returns to OK.

The vehicle returns to IDLE status.

System statistics are updated (completed tasks, total distance, average ETA).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Visualization

Simulation Tab:

Real-time map (bins, vehicles, alerts).

Vehicle movement & route visualization.

Speech synthesis for task updates.

System stats panel showing live KPIs.

Dashboard Tab:

Separate gauges for Air Quality and Water Quality (simulated sensors).

Waste Management panels showing:

Active bin levels.

Vehicle statuses.

Assignments & comparison stats.

System performance summary.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Automation & Continuous Loop

The Auto Mode (/start_auto) runs a background simulation thread:

Random bins fill gradually.

Automatic alerts & assignments keep the cycle running continuously.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Overview

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet + Chart.js)

Database (simulated): In-memory Python lists

Visualization: Leaflet map + voice feedback

AI Layer (future-ready): Predictive cleaning & anomaly detection

üèÜ Pitch Line

‚ÄúA real-time IoT-enabled campus waste management system that detects, dispatches, and monitors bin cleaning autonomously ‚Äî with intelligent route assignment, voice-assisted alerts, and live dashboard analytics.‚Äù
