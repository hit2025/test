🌐 1. Real-Time Smart Campus Environment

The system represents a smart campus setup with:

IoT-enabled waste bins (with fill-level sensors like Ultrasonic, EC, Gas sensors)

GPS-equipped smart vehicles (for waste collection)

LoRa/NB-IoT/Wi-Fi network for continuous communication

Central AI dashboard for monitoring and control

All data is processed through the FastAPI backend and visualized live on an interactive Leaflet.js map dashboard.

🧩 2. Sensor Data Collection

Each bin sends real-time fill-level and gas data to the backend.

The backend updates the status (OK / FULL) of bins in the system.

When a bin crosses a threshold (e.g., >90%), it triggers an alert event.

🤖 3. AI-Based Predictive Bin Filling

The AI model (built using linear regression or LSTM-based prediction) learns fill patterns over time using:

Historical fill data

Time intervals

Usage density

Weather / event-based variations

Based on this, it predicts future fill levels and identifies bins that will be full soon, even before they actually overflow.
✅ Advantage: Enables predictive cleaning rather than reactive cleaning.

🚗 4. Dynamic Route Optimization (AI + Geo Intelligence)

When bins become full or predicted to be full:

The system identifies nearest available vehicles.

Calculates real distances using the Haversine formula (Earth-surface distance).

Applies AI-based route optimization (similar to Dijkstra/A* logic) to find:

Shortest or most fuel-efficient route

Multi-bin optimized path when multiple pickups are required

Assigns the most suitable vehicle to that route.

✅ AI ensures minimum fuel usage, reduced travel time, and balanced workload.

🗺️ 5. Real-Time Simulation Dashboard

The main dashboard (for control room/admin) shows:

Live bin statuses with color indicators (green → orange → red)

Vehicle movement animation with route glow

Auto/Manual control for bin assignment

System statistics (total trips, total distance, avg ETA)

Voice assistant announcing bin alerts and trip completions
✅ Gives a digital twin view of campus waste operations

👨‍✈️ 6. Driver Dashboard (Field-Level Interface)

Each vehicle has a dedicated driver dashboard (accessible via /driver_dashboard?id=X):

Shows the assigned bin’s location and optimized route

Displays live movement like Uber/Ola navigation

Speaks out English instructions (“Proceed to Bin 4…”, “Trip completed…”)

Maintains driver-specific statistics:

Total trips completed

Total distance traveled
✅ Enhances field coordination and autonomy

📈 7. Centralized Monitoring & AI Layer

The backend continuously:

Records route data, completion time, and distance

Feeds that back into the AI prediction module

Uses this feedback loop to improve route and schedule predictions for the future

✅ Self-learning system — becomes smarter over time.
